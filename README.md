# RSE

This project allows you to simulate a setellite trajectory by means of it's TLE.

Though it is not working properly, it can help you to understand the basics of satellite motion.

The TLE.txt file is for two-line element set.

The controls.txt file is for changing the initial parameters of the simulation. 
First two lines are latitude and longitude. The third - start time point. The fourth - end time point.

The result of the simulation will be a 3D plot of the Earth and ship's relative position and the dependence of the elevation angle on the direction.
